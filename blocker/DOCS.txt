The purpose of writing this app was to help other programmers be able of handling this problem with ease

delete accounts that make malicious attempts on your website
Note:
    this app doesnt spot malicious attempts on its own
    call this function after defining a malicious attempt youself and inside your view
    E.g:
        
   """  if request.user.is_superuser:
            #somecode
        else:
            return spot_mal_and_act(request.user)"""

SETTING UP THE APP:
    1.first go to your projects settings.py and include the app

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'blocker'
    ]

    2.run this in your project directory
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate
    
    3.in your views.py add this import statements
        from blocker.security import spot_mal_and_act,set_home_page
    
    4.set your return or homepage
        your homepage or default page in this case means the page that users will be lead to after any malicous attempt
        this should probably be the last line of code in your views.py


        target = url_name
        set_home_page(target)

        target in this case should be the name of a url
